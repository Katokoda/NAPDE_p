========== Project 3 (Semilinear elliptic equation) - Numerical Approximation of PDEs ==========
By Estelle Baup and Samuel BÃ©lisle.

In this file we explain what is important for you to understand and test our project.

We followed the scheme and notations of the given instructions, which are in nonlinear_proj.pdf. Our answers and explications are in the file Answers.pdf. This report is mainly a summary of the results we obtain with our code. To use our code, one needs to run Project_SEZAM.py with Python, with the desired function(s) of the main uncommented.  By default, it will run 5 functions, 2 for the fixed-point scheme (alpha=0.1 and alpha=2) and 3 for the Newton scheme (alpha=0.1, alpha=2 and alpha=5), and a bonus run with a dense and the Newton method. Note that the auxiliary files (integrate.py, mesh.py, util.py, quad.py, solve.py) need to be in the folder from which the file is running.

We believe that all the needed information is in this report and the code. Feel free to contact one of us with our EPFL mail if necessary.
